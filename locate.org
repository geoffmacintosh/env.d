#+title: Locate

I am currently using mdfind on macOS and plocate on Linux.

There is some [[https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=906591][issue with pruning bind mounts on BTRFS subvolumes]], so we disable the it which is the default that the system is supposed to use. Not sure what the downsides are this way and why so many distributions change the default? Whatever.

I'd really rather not alter the main conf file as pacman will complain whenever there are updates, but I don't think there's a good alternative. I don't bother to do anything fancy with tangling because there's no such file on macOS. That will come back to bite me for sure.
